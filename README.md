Expense tracking + insights for students and young professionals.
MVP focuses on transaction logging, CSV import, analytics dashboards, and budget alerts.
Later phases add goal planning and ML-based classification.

## Monorepo structure
- `frontend/` — Next.js (TypeScript) web app
- `backend/` — FastAPI (Python) API service

- Phase 1: backend CRUD + DB schema + CSV import
- Phase 2: frontend dashboard + charts
- Phase 3: analytics + goals
- Phase 4: ML classifier
- Phase 5: deployment + CI
